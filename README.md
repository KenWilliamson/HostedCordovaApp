# A hosted Cordova App that run in client mode.

## This is a proof of concept project that uses a version of the ManifoldCordova plugin that I modified to work in client mode on the Android platform.


## This mobile works completely in the client mode and requires not Cordova files to be deployed the the server and requires not changes to the server.
