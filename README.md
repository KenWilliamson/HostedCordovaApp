## A hosted Cordova App that runs in client mode to wrap an Angular 2 application. 
(https://github.com/KenWilliamson/CloudMobileCordova.git)

#### This is a proof of concept project that uses a version of the ManifoldCordova plugin that I modified to work in client mode on the Android platform.


#### This mobile application works completely in the client mode and requires not Cordova files to be deployed to the server and requires no changes to the server.
